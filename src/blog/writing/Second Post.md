- “In American history, there was an opportunity for there to be a turning point after the Civil War, during Reconstruction,” says Clark. “But what actually held on — what endured — was what was surrendered, or the Confederate battle flag. And I think that says a lot about where we are currently.”[^1]

- What opportunity does a truce between two sides of the same white supremacist violent state apparatus present for racial injustice?
- And why is the truce the symbol we should remember? I keep thinking about Derrick Bell’s [[interest convergence]]
