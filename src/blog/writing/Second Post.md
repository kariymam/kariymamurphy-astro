## This is some text

This is some text with a footnote[^1]

- Incredible feat because it is painstakingly large and intricate.
- I could barely fit it in a photo without backing up into the brick wall piece.
- But what does a truce between enemies mean when the enemies remain enemies of Black liberation?
- “In American history, there was an opportunity for there to be a turning point after the Civil War, during Reconstruction,” says Clark. “But what actually held on — what endured — was what was surrendered, or the Confederate battle flag. And I think that says a lot about where we are currently.”[^2]
- Turning point.
- The dish cloth is ambiguous because it’s in liminal space where change could “happen” within the context of white supremacist violence that is designed to seem inevitable.
- What opportunity does a truce between two sides of the same white supremacist violent state apparatus present for racial injustice?
- And why is the truce the symbol we should remember? I keep thinking about Derrick Bell’s [[interest convergence]]
