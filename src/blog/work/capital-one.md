### What

- I designed UI for a new business process to alleviate Capital One associates from a highly manual and repetitive side-of-desk task.

- The new process eliminated time-consuming manual reviews of datasets, making progress towards reducing costs and consolidating the fulfillment process across lines of business.

- Reduced compliance risk and provided customers with more fine-grained privacy controls for an enhanced privacy experience.

### Why

1. To centralize the privacy, compliance, and governance process and integrate automated controls within a data management platform—which I'll call OneData (not the actual name).

2. To anticipate privacy legislation after the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and with the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) on the horizon.

### How

- Worked with the research team to complete a **competitive analysis** determining how Capital One's data request portal compared to other companies in the financial and tech landscape. The process and resulting insights influenced the **product definition** and alignment across design, research, and product.

- Conducted unmoderated **usability testing** using **usertesting.com** to test UI designed in **Figma** allowing consumers to see past their request history. Success was based on task completion and the results helped identify experience gaps to improve before release.

- Worked together with content design, research, and product to facilitate **moderated user interviews** for testing the site employees would use to transition manual and repetitive aspects of the privacy decision-making process into OneData.

### Key Accomplishment 

The new process featuring the UI components launched in a closed pilot which generated an NPS of 50 and 75% ease of use score from managers and directors across multiple LOBs with heavy datasets, who were the most overburdened by the current process. It also drove business efficiencies, including a 50% decrease in the number of days to decide a dataset, and on average, saved ~500 hours/month in employee time.

### Feedback

> "With much of our work being cross-team and involving alignment across different priorities, Kariyma is already great at understanding concerns and addressing them in the designs."
