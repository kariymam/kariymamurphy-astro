| ------- | ----------- |
| When    | Feb. 2021 - Aug. 2022    |
| Who     | Regulators, employees using data, and privacy-minded consumers looking to exercise their data    |
| What    | Web, mobile     |

**All mockups and prototypes have been recreated and genericized due to file-sharing and confidentiality restrictions.**

### What

1. Design user flow for an overhaul of the privacy decision-making business process; specifically, determining whether a dataset contained personally identifiable information (PII) that consumers could request to download, correct, or delete.

2. Revamp the UI to include consumer controls required by the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) to minimize compliance risk and propose measurable improvements to the data request portal.

3. Design a transparency report for web and mobile needed to reduce compliance risk.

### Why

1. To centralize the privacy, compliance, and governance process and integrating automated controls within a data management platform—which I'll call OneData (not the actual name).

2. To anticipate privacy, especially after California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and with California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) right on the horizon.

The goals were to:

- Alleviate the burden of privacy as a side-of-desk job

- Eliminate time-consuming manual reviews of datasets

- Reduce costs from heavy contractor deployment

- Consolidate the federated fulfillment process across lines of business

- Not only reducing compliance risk but provide customers with more fine-grained privacy controls for an enhanced privacy experience

*A key factor here is there was no starting from scratch—Capital One is a big company, and all the work I iterated was started by other designers.

### How

- *Enhancing the overall privacy experience*: I worked alongside the research team to complete a **competitive analysis** determining how Capital One's data request portal compared in the financial and tech landscape. The insights influenced the **product definition** and alignment between design, research, and product partners.

- *Improving understandability*: I designed UI in **Figma** allowing consumers to see past their request history and conducted unmoderated **usability testing** using **usertesting.com** to ensure that the new design did not impact usability. I measured success based on task completion and found that with the majority of customers could find and complete the intended tasks, however customers consistently had apprehension about the nature their data.

- *Centralizing privacy*: Alongside the research team I faciliated **moderated user interviews** for testing new components that would take the privacy decision-making process off spreadsheets an into OneData design ecosystem. Product and I tested using a **userflow** and **clickable-prototype** hybrid I designed in **Figma** which helped document the new process. The components I designed were either in accordance with the established OneData **design system** or proposed enhancements that based on usefulness for users beyond privacy. Product and I also aligned on writing privacy content in plain-english so anyone who does not speak legalese could still make informed decisions.

- *Key Accomplishment*: The new process featuring the UI components launched in a closed pilot which generated an NPS of 50 and 75% ease of use score from managers and directors across multiple LOBs with heavy datasets, who were the most overburdened by the current process. It also drove business efficiencies, including a 50% decrease in the number of days to decide a dataset, and on average, saved ~500 hours/month in employee time.

### Feedback

"With much of our work being cross-team and involving alignment across different priorities, Kariyma is already great at understanding concerns and addressing them in the designs."

- *Automated controls*: I created a **business process flow** in Google Draw to share with product managers based on documentation and interviews with managers who walked me through the manual privacy review process. Having first-hand accounts helped me quickly get up to speed when I pulled findings and opportunities from previous research. This process flow was used to align on areas to introduce automation within OneData.

### TLDR

- Designed UI for a new business process to alleviate Capital One associates from a highly manual and repetitive side-of-desk task.

- The new process eliminated time-consuming manual reviews of datasets, making progress towards reducing costs from heavy contractor deployment and consolidating the federated fulfillment process across lines of business.

- Reduced compliance risk and provided customers with more fine-grained privacy controls for an enhanced privacy experience.
