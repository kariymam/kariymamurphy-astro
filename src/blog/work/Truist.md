I was brought on the Commerical Banking team as a Senior UI Designer to support the redesign SunTrust's commerical banking mobile app; specifically the payments and transfers feature on Android and iOS. 

Working in a post-merger environment came with its challenges; new teams, developer turnover, and a hard deadline to launch the new app by 2021 added a significant sense of urgency. And when I joined, the team was still missing a user experience designer.

I started a decision log posted weekly to Slack when I noticed our team struggling to track frequent—often cascading—changes coming from the enterprise team, which helped centralize knowledge and open communication channels between teams. But documenting decisions and changes in places like Slack and Adobe XD could only be a bandaid over more pressing issues, like lacking enterprise-led standards for content management.

One opportunity was adapting the statuses and notifications design system created by the enterprise design team to work for Bill Pay statuses and notifications—based on BB&T's Bill Pay features—which did not exist for SunTrust.
