## Accomplishments

- The new process eliminated time-consuming manual reviews of datasets, making progress towards reducing costs from heavy contractor deployment and consolidating the federated fulfillment process across lines of business. The result was a 50% decrease in the number of days to decide a dataset, and on average, saved ~500 hours/month in employee time.
- On the customer-facing side, I documented and delivered the user flow for the "Correction" experience, required by CPRA. Including this screen helped meet KPIs to reduce compliance risk and provide customers with more fine-grained privacy controls for an enhanced privacy experience.
