## Accomplishments

- A new user interface for a privacy scopingÂ that eliminated time-consuming manual reviews of datasets. The result was a 50% decrease in the number of days to process dataset, and on average, saved ~500 hours/month in employee time and reduced costs from heavy contractor deployment.
- On the customer-facing side, I documented and delivered the user flow for the customer dataset "Correction" experience, required by CPRA, resulting in compliance with the law and avoiding hefty fines.
